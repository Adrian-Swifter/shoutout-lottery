# Shoutout or promote lottery app

This app is built using: React, Node, Firebase.
You can see app in action here: https://www.loom.com/share/073a1e95e4a743a6971f08cc04717f7f

Users can make a new account and submit the link they want to promote and a brief description. Every day, or every time interval which will probably be 24h in production, users can enter the pool of users who want to participate in the given shoutout period. After the period ends, one user is randomly chosen and their link will be on display until the timer runs out. The condition for entering the pool would be that you need to click on the link which is on display first.
